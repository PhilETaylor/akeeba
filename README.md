# Akeeba Bundle for Symfony 3

This started out as a reuasable bundle for Symfony 3 in order to consume the JSON API from Akeeba Backup

However it now has a dependancy for Redis and some hard coded redis strings, and dependancy on a Site entity too - maybe I'll strip those back out someday, however for now im the only one using this...
